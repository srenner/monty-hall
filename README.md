# monty-hall

This project is the code that is being built to run on montyhall.dev

montyhall.dev is a small app that demonstrates the "Monty Hall" brain teaser that came to prominence when it was featured in Marilyn vos Savant's "Ask Marilyn" column in Parade magazine in 1990. This app gives a visual and statistical demonstration on how most people come to the wrong conclusion when playing the game.
